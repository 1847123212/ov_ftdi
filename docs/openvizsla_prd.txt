OpenVizsla product requirements definition

Target users:
USB driver developers, reverse engineers, USB hardware developers


Requirements:
* self-contained unit
* inexpensive -- $250 or cheaper
* small -- comparable in size to an 2.5" external hard drive
* compatibility with USB 1.1/2.0 (LS/FS/HS)
* connects to host machine using high-speed USB2.0
* collects all data connecting between two machines at the USB PHY level
* buffer memory to allow collection of bursty data
* LEDs to indicate capture status
* Unique VID/PID
* open design information, including published schematics and protocol / data format
* reprogrammable (nonvolatile) devices can be reflashed in most cases without specialized hardware

Nice to have
* unused GPIOs brought out to a header
* trigger button
* compression of data to allow streaming 480Mbps collection
* filtering of data to allow streaming 480Mbps collection
* USB current draw measurement

Software/firmware
Reference firmware/ HDL will be provided (in source and binary form), sufficient to test and demonstrate all basic functionality.  Basic cross-platform libusb-based command line utilities (with source) will be provided to allow the firmware to be controlled / updated, and data collected. Raw data format will be documented, and a converter will be provided to convert the raw data to a format that Wireshark can parse (e.g. usbmon -- note that this may require discarding some data).

Distribution
OpenVizsla will be provided to KickStarter backers as a raw PCB, a kit (??), a bare assembled PCB, and a complete unit with enclosure and cables. 

Out of scope:
* No GUI will be provided (but we will make it easy for a third party to write one)
